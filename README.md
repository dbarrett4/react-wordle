# react-wordle
A simple [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) remake. Made using [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) library.

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed before attempting to run this project. I developed it on v18.17.1 so I recommend being on at least that.

## Run locally
1. Fork the repository by clicking on `Fork` option on the top right of the repository.
2. Open Command Prompt or Git Bash on your local computer. (Git Bash recommended).
3. Clone the forked repository by adding your own GitHub username in place of `<username>`.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/react-wordle
   ```
4. Navigate to the cloned respository.
5. Run the development server.
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) or `Ctrl + Click` on the link in your terminal.
